To predict the risk of heart disease using ML algorithm

In my healthcare project aimed at predicting heart disease risk, I built machine learning models using both logistic regression and a random forest classifier. The dataset included various features such as age, sex, chest pain type (cp), cholesterol levels, resting blood pressure (trestbp), exercise-induced angina (exang), number of major vessels (ca), and thalassemia (thal). The goal was to predict whether an individual is prone to heart disease based on these independent variables.

I began with extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset. This involved visualizing data distributions using box plots and pair plots, and studying correlations between features to identify significant predictors. Handling outliers was a crucial step to ensure robust model performance, achieved through methods like interquartile range analysis.

Feature engineering was an integral part of the process, transforming raw data into meaningful inputs for the models. This included encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and creating interaction terms where necessary.

Logistic regression was employed for its simplicity and interpretability, providing insights into how each feature contributes to heart disease risk. Additionally, I used a random forest classifier to capture non-linear relationships and interactions between variables, enhancing prediction accuracy.

Model performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1-score. Cross-validation ensured that the models generalize well to unseen data. To further validate the findings, I used statistical models, reinforcing the robustness of the predictions.

Ultimately, both logistic regression and the random forest classifier showed promising results in predicting heart disease risk. The insights gained from this project can aid in early detection and preventive measures, contributing to better healthcare outcomes. This comprehensive approach combining EDA, feature engineering, and multiple modeling techniques underscored the importance of machine learning in healthcare diagnostics.
